This book enables you to quickly create robust, reliable, and reusable Python applications by teaching the basics so you can quickly develop Web and scientific applications, incorporate databases, and master systems tasks on various operating systems, including Linux, MAC OS, and Windows. You\u2019ll get a comprehensive tutorial that guides you from writing simple, basic Python scripts all the way through complex concepts, and also features a reference of the standard modules with examples illustrating how to implement features in the various modules. Plus, the book covers using Python in specific program development domains, such as XML, databases, scientific applications, network programming, and Web developmen",

We start with an introduc-tion to Python, the programming language we will use in the lab sessions, and to Matplotlib and Numpy, two modules for plotting and scientific computing in Python, respectively. Afterwards, we present several notions on probability theory and linear algebra. Finally, we focus on numerical optimization. The goal of this class is to give you the basic knowledge for you to understand the following lectures. We will not enter in too much detail in any of the topics",

          "Abstract": "Background: Python is one of the most popular modern programming languages. In 2008 its authors introduced a new version of the language, Python 3.0, that was not backward compatible with Python 2, initiating a transitional phase for Python software developers. Aims: The study described in this paper investigates the degree to which Python software developers are making the transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Method: We have developed a Python compliance analyser, PyComply, and have assembled a large corpus of Python applications. We use PyComply to measure and quantify the degree to which Python 3 features are being used, as well as the rate and context of their adoption. Results: In fact, Python software developers are not exploiting the new features and advantages of Python 3, but rather are choosing to retain backward compatibility with Python 2. Conclusions: Python developers are confining themselves to a language subset, governed by the diminishing intersection of Python 2, which is not under development, and Python 3, which is under development with new features being introduced as the language continues to evolve",

          "Abstract": "Background: Python is one of the most popular modern programming languages. In 2008 its authors introduced a new version of the language, Python 3.0, that was not backward compatible with Python 2, initiating a transitional phase for Python software developers. Aims: The study described in this paper investigates the degree to which Python software developers are making the transition from Python 2 to Python 3. Method: We have developed a Python compliance analyser, PyComply, and have assembled a large corpus of Python applications. We use PyComply to measure and quantify the degree to which Python 3 features are being used, as well as the rate and context of their adoption. Results: In fact, Python software developers are not exploiting the new features and advantages of Python 3, but rather are choosing to retain backward compatibility with Python 2. Conclusions: Python developers are confining themselves to a language subset, governed by the diminishing intersection of Python 2, which is not under development, and Python 3, which is under development with new features being introduced as the language continues to evolve",
