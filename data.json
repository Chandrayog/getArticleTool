Evidence in literature has shown that the past and ongoing research has an enormous implication in improving the clinical outcome in breast cancer. This has been attributed to the progress made in the realm of screening, diagnosis and therapeutic strategies engaged in breast cancer management. However, poor prognosis in TNBC and drug resistance presents major inhibitions which are also current challenges for containing the disease. Similarly, a focal point of concern is the rising rate of breast cancer incidence and mortality among the population of under developed world. In this chapter, an overview of the current practices for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and associated impediments has been provided.",

          "Abstract": "Despite dramatic advances in cancer research setting, breast cancer remains a major health problem and represents currently a top biomedical research priority. Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women, and its incidence and mortality rates are expected to increase significantly the next years. Recently the researchers' interest has been attracted by breast cancer arising in young women. Current evidence suggests that in women aged <45 years, breast cancer is unquestionably the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This type of cancer seems to be highly heterogeneous and has potentially aggressive and complex biological features. However, management strategies, recommendations and options are not age based and the 'complex' biology of this type of cancer remains uncertain and unexplored. In this review, we summarize the latest scientific information on breast cancer arising in young women highlighting the heterogeneity and the complex nature of this type of cancer.",

          "Abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and is the second cancer frequently occurring worldwide of newly-diagnosed cancers. There is much evidence showing the influence of life style and environmental factors on the development of mammary gland cancer (high-fat diet, alcohol consumption, lack of physical exercise), the elimination of which (primary prevention) may contribute to a decrease in morbidity and mortality. Secondary prevention, comprising diagnostic tests (e.g. mammography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, breast self-examination, as well as modern and more precise imaging methods) help the early detection of tumours or lesions predisposing to tumours.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study paper is to review current knowledge and reports regarding primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.\n    \n\n\n          State of knowledge:\n        \n      \n      It is estimated that nearly 70% of malign tumours are caused by environmental factors, whereas in breast cancer this percentage reaches 90-95%. There are national programmes established in many countries to fight cancer, where both types of prevention are stressed as serving to decrease morbidity and mortality due to cancers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Cancer prevention is currently playing a key role in the fight against the disease. Behaviour modification, as well as greater awareness among women regarding breast cancer, may significantly contribute towards reducing the incidence of this cancer. Another important aspect is the number of women undergoing diagnostic tests, which still remains at an unsatisfactory level.",

          "Abstract": "In this article, the American Cancer Society provides an overview of female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including trends in incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Approximately 230,480 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,520 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among US women in 2011. Breast cancer incidence rates were stable among all racial/ethnic groups from 2004 to 2008. Breast cancer death rates have been declining since the early 1990s for all women except American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. Disparities in breast cancer death rates are evident by state, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. While significant declines in mortality rates were observed for 36 states and the District of Columbia over the past 10 years, rates for 14 states remained level. Analyses by county-level poverty rates showed that the decrease in mortality rates began later and was slower among women residing in poor areas. As a result, the highest breast cancer death rates shifted from the affluent areas to the poor areas in the early 1990s. Screening rates continue to be lower in poor women compared with non-poor women, despite much progress in increasing mammography utilization. In 2008, 51.4% of poor women had undergone a screening mammogram in the past 2 years compared with 72.8% of non-poor women. Encouraging patients aged 40 years and older to have annual mammography and a clinical breast examination is the single most important step that clinicians can take to reduce suffering and death from breast cancer. Clinicians should also ensure that patients at high risk of breast cancer are identified and offered appropriate screening and follow-up. Continued progress in the control of breast cancer will require sustained and increased efforts to provide high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment to all segments of the population.",

          "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women and ranks second among causes for cancer related death in women. The ability to identify and diagnose breast cancer has improved markedly. Treatment decisions which were based in the past predominantly on the anatomic extent of the disease are shifting to the underlying biological mechanisms. Gene array technology has led to the recognition that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease composed of different biological subtypes, and genetic profiling enables response to chemotherapy to be predicted. Breast conservation became an established standard of care and the oncoplastic approach enables wide excisions without compromising the natural shape of the breast. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has replaced axillary dissection as the standard procedure to stage the axilla and spared many patients the excess morbidity of axillary dissection. Targeted therapy to the oestrogen receptor plays a major role in systemic therapy; pathways responsible for endocrine resistance have been targeted as well. Biological therapy has been developed to target HER2 receptor and combination of antibody drug conjugates linked cytotoxic therapy to HER2 antibodies. Meaningful improvements in survival resulted from the new effective systemic agents and patients with metastasis are likely to have a longer survival.",

          "Abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and survivors with this diagnosis account for almost one fourth of the over 14 million cancer survivors in the US. After several decades of basic and clinical trials research, we have learned much about the heterogeneity of breast cancer and have evolved a complex and multidisciplinary treatment approach to the disease. Increasingly, we are paying attention to the long term and late effects of breast cancer treatment, and this is largely the subject of this volume. In this chapter, the authors introduce the topic of breast cancer survivorship and highlight the organization and content of this volume, briefly describing the contents of the subsequent chapters.",
