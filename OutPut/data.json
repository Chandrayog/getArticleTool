          "Abstract": "ObjectiveGiven the availability of extensive digitized healthcare data from medical records, claims and prescription information, it is now possible to use hypothesis-free, data-driven approaches to mine medical databases for novel insight. The goal of this analysis was to demonstrate the use of artificial intelligence based methods such as Bayesian networks to open up opportunities for creation of new knowledge in management of chronic conditions. Materials and methodsHospital level Medicare claims data containing discharge numbers for most common diagnoses were analyzed in a hypothesis-free manner using Bayesian networks learning methodology. ResultsWhile many interactions identified between discharge rates of diagnoses using this data set are supported by current medical knowledge, a novel interaction linking asthma and renal failure was discovered. This interaction is non-obvious and had not been looked at by the research and clinical communities in epidemiological or clinical data. A plausible pharmacological explanation of this link is proposed together with a verification of the risk significance by conventional statistical analysis. ConclusionPotential clinical and molecular pathways defining the relationship between commonly used asthma medications and renal disease are discussed. The study underscores the need for further epidemiological research to validate this novel hypothesis. Validation will lead to advancement in clinical treatment of asthma & bronchitis, thereby, improving patient outcomes and leading to long term cost savings. In summary, this study demonstrates that application of advanced artificial intelligence methods in healthcare has the potential to enhance the quality of care by discovering non-obvious, clinically relevant relationships and enabling timely care intervention.",

          "Abstract": "The objective of this paper is to demonstrate link intelligence that characterizes neurocognitive knowledge processing capabilities through dynamic knowledge development, learning and stability within a given knowledge network. The existing knowledge networks connect two or more data nodes with edges that have no intelligence embedded into them and provide for static information connectivity and retrieval. This paper focuses on the link intelligence that contributes towards the development of neurocognitive knowledge network model (NCKM) with autonomous processing nodes. Links in NCKM exhibit neurocognitive knowledge processing characteristics by virtue of its four properties viz. efficient knowledge assimilation, self-directivity, self-organization, and equilibrium. The simulation results comprise searching different concepts from NCKM to retrieve knowledge threads for the searched concept. The results exhibit the significance of link-weight gradation in self-directivity and self-organization of links for intelligent knowledge retrieval. The results also demonstrate the significance of equilibrium process to maintain stability in the knowledge network, by limiting the link-weight values within the saturation limits. Additionally, the results depict the criticality of coupling retrieval of random concepts with equilibrium process in providing knowledge build-up and learning within NCKM. NCKM with its intelligent links and processing nodes finds its applicability in many cognitive and intelligent systems.",

These estimators, also known as software sensors have been successfully applied in many chemical process systems such as reactors, distillation columns, and heat exchanger due to their robustness, simple formulation, adaptation capabilities and minimum modelling requirements for the design. However, the various types of AI methods available make it difficult to decide on the most suitable algorithm to be applied for any particular system. Hence, in this paper, we provide a broad literature survey of several AI algorithms implemented as estimators in chemical systems together with their advantages, limitations, practical implications and comparisons between one another to guide researchers in selecting and designing the AI-based estimators. Future research suggestions and directions in improvising and extending the usage of these estimators in various chemical operating units are also presented.",

          "Abstract": "Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained considerable popularity for the development of distributed enterprise-wide applications within the software industry. The SOA paradigm promotes the reusability and integrability of software in heterogeneous environments by means of open standards. Most software companies capitalize on SOA by discovering and composing services already accessible over the Internet, whereas other organizations need internal control of applications and develop new services with quality-attribute properties tailored to their particular environment. Therefore, based on architectural and business requirements, developers can elaborate different alternatives within a SOA framework to design their software applications. Each of these alternatives will imply trade-offs among quality attributes, such as performance, dependability and availability, among others. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can assist developers in dealing with service-oriented design with the positive impact on scalability and management of generic quality attributes. In this paper, we offer a detailed, conceptualized and synthesized analysis of AI research works that have aimed at discovering, composing, or developing services. We also identify open research issues and challenges in the aforementioned research areas. The results of the characterization of 69 contemporary approaches and potential research directions for the areas are also shown. It is concluded that AI has aimed at exploiting the semantic resources and achieving quality-attribute properties so as to produce flexible and adaptive-to-change service discovery, composition, and development.",

          "Abstract": "Although the original vision for artificial intelligence was the simulation of (implicitly human) intelligence, research has gradually shifted to autonomous systems that compete with people. The resultant popular attitude toward artificial intelligence, we argue here, is by turns disdain, grudging acceptance, and fear. That attitude not only limits our work's potential, but also imperils its support. This paper proposes a constructive alternative: the development of collaborative intelligence. As envisioned here, a collaborative intelligence does not require encyclopedic command and need not be limited to a single problem. The necessary components of a collaborative intelligence are nearly at hand, and the key issues readily identified. As a first step, this paper proposes three challenging but accessible problems that would both change the public perception of artificial intelligence and spur substantive research to advance our science.",

          "Abstract": "A transportation network is a layout of connections, in a region, between communities of people developed in the course of interaction of economic and social, as well as natural environment factors. The current form of transportation network is the result of long term development, which started with the first settlements in the region. When in the course of history, a modernization or an expansion was done, it was to fulfil the new transport requirements, and the work was based on the current structure of the transportation network. These temporary requirements mostly arouse due to random factors which as time went by ceased to prevail. As a consequence the structure, as a rule, is not optimal. At the moment, we can observe a steep increase of communication needs associated with the intensification of economic growth, rising affluence of society and urbanization of new areas. The paper deals with the problem of the transportation network development in response to the new demands. The task is to minimize the total network impedance taking into account the constraints of the investment budget. A bi-level model of the transportation network consisting of some classes of road links was developed. At the upper level the objective function is the usage cost expressed by the total travelling time. At the lower level, at each procedure step the optimal distribution of the traffic is searched for. The main aim was to indicate the most advantageous and acceptable directions of development of the transportation network.",

Stigma associated with mental illness promotes silos that prevent full integration of a person living within a dynamic and contextualized matrix. Traditional regression modeling strategies fail to embrace dynamic health patterns within systems. Synthesizing systems science, agent modeling and simulation, knowledge management architecture and domain theories, we explore the use of Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) for understanding individual, organizational, and societal levels of a hospitalization. In essence, we apply computational science to explore underlying mechanisms that explain medical/surgical hospital outcomes \u2013 readmissions \u2013 for individuals with comorbid physical and mental illness. In the first section of this chapter, ABMS is conceptualized. Then, a case study serves to demonstrate an ABMS application and gains from knowledge that is unique to this systems social science approach. We conclude with a discussion of strengths and limitations of the ABMS application.",

          "Abstract": "Diagnosing a patient's condition is one of the most important and challenging tasks in medicine. We present a study of the application of collective intelligence in medical diagnosis by applying consensus methods. We compared the accuracy obtained with this method against the diagnostics accuracy reached through the knowledge of a single expert. We used the ontological structures of ten diseases. Two knowledge bases were created by placing five diseases into each knowledge base. We conducted two experiments, one with an empty knowledge base and the other with a populated knowledge base. For both experiments, five experts added and/or eliminated signs/symptoms and diagnostic tests for each disease. After this process, the individual knowledge bases were built based on the output of the consensus methods. In order to perform the evaluation, we compared the number of items for each disease in the agreed knowledge bases against the number of items in the GS (Gold Standard). We identified that, while the number of items in each knowledge base is higher, the consensus level is lower. In all cases, the lowest level of agreement (20%) exceeded the number of signs that are in the GS. In addition, when all experts agreed, the number of items decreased. The use of collective intelligence can be used to increase the consensus of physicians. This is because, by using consensus, physicians can gather more information and knowledge than when obtaining information and knowledge from knowledge bases fed or populated from the knowledge found in the literature, and, at the same time, they can keep updated and collaborate dynamically.",

This paper systematically examines computational intelligence-based transfer learning techniques and clusters related technique developments into four main categories: (a) neural network-based transfer learning; (b) Bayes-based transfer learning; (c) fuzzy transfer learning, and (d) applications of computational intelligence-based transfer learning.

          "Abstract": "The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is becoming increasingly knowledge intensive. Knowledge management has been hailed as an enabler for tapping this knowledge to improve efficiency in the AEC industry. In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use. A French AEC company located in the Southwest region was employed as a case study in illustrating knowledge modeling through the experience feedback process. For each phase of experience feedback, actions that were implemented in the company are discussed.",

          "Abstract": "We will focus in this paper on the competitive intelligence problem which deals with the competitive environment of a company. Our purpose is to predict and anticipate the action of its competitor. We are talking here about a context of reasoning under uncertainty. All existed works define the concept of competitive intelligence and propose a scheme for the competitive intelligence process and its stages, but there is no work, at the best of our knowledge, that touched the practical aspect of the field or developed a complete competitive intelligence solution that can be delivered to the decision maker, which makes the originality of our work. To motivate the research, we will address a competitive practical case in the field of telecommunications. In this paper we propose a competitive intelligence solution composed by two steps: actions association using k-modes algorithm which has the capability to deal with nominal data, and actions generation using rough set theory which has the capability to deal with inexact data and drive rules from it.",

First, it suggests a theoretical approach, even though the theory comes with a clear methodology and implementation, so that we know what we do, how we do it, and why it is best to do it that way. Second, it pushes forward HARMS communication in natural language and explains why it is better that way. Third, it insists on the semantic approach so that all the HARMS agents \u201cunderstand\u201d (or even understand) what is going on--along with what is not. Fourth, most specifically and, hence, perhaps least importantly, it proposes one particular method of doing it, mildly hinting that some of its principles are unavoidable.",

          "Abstract": "In this paper, a comprehensive model is introduced to investigate the influence of energy flow on the lifetime of stochastic multi-species prey\u2013predator artificial ecosystems. The model consists of a non-stationary hosting environment with food sources and a few species of competing herbivore and carnivore birds that can perform several individual and collective behaviors such as flocking, breeding, competing, resting, hunting, escaping, seeking, and foraging. The experimental results of 11,000 simulations analyzed by Cox univariate analysis and hazard function suggest that only a fraction of associated energy variables and pairwise interactions between them influence the lifetime. The proposed stochastic model can be utilized to simulate the complex multi-agent systems and their emergent behavior. Also, the proposed statistical analysis of energy flow to estimate the system stability and lifetime can be generalized to other physical and economical complex systems.",

          "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach in multidisciplinary design of mechatronic systems, using an inductive genetic programming (IGP) along with a bond graph modeling tool (BG). The proposed design algorithm dynamically explores the space of finding optimal design solutions through utilizing two navigated steps for simultaneous optimization of both topology and parameters. In the first step, an IGP tool is applied on the bond graph embryo model of the system for topology synthesis. In the second step, an optimization tool that incorporates an artificial immune system (AIS) is implemented for optimization of the parameter values. A supervisory loop statistically analyzes the efficiency of the different mechatronic elements in improving the system\u05f3s performance. By acquiring knowledge and learning from prior trials, the evolution parameters are automatically and dynamically adjusted, with the aim to achieve more efficient evolution progress. The developed method is practically compared with an available bond graph-genetic programming (BGGP) method via designing an aerospace engine mount system. Results show that more navigated and accurate design results are acquired from the proposed method.",

          "Abstract": "Argumentation theory is an area of interdisciplinary research that is suitable to characterise several diverse situations of reasoning and judgement in real world practices and challenges. In the discipline of Artificial Intelligence, argumentation is formalised by reasoning models based on building and evaluation of interacting arguments. In this argumentation framework, the semantics of acceptance plays a fundamental role in the argument evaluation process. The determination of accepted arguments under a given semantics (admissible, preferred, stable, etc.) can be a time-consuming and tedious (in number of steps) process. In this work we try to overcome this substantial process by providing a method to compute accepted arguments from an argumentation framework. The principle of this method is to combine mathematical properties (e.g. symmetry, asymmetry, strong connectivity and irreflexivity) of graphs built from the argumentation system to compute sets of accepted arguments. In this work, we combine several graph properties to provide three main propositions; one for identifying accepted arguments under the admissible, preferred semantics and the other to easily identify stable extension. The proofs of the suggested propositions are detailed and this is part of an approach designed to increase collaborative decision-making by improving the effectiveness of reasoning processes.",

We introduce CONSERT, an approach for context meta-modeling offering a consistent and uniform means for working with domain knowledge, as well as constraints and meta-properties thereof. We provide a formalization of the model and detail its innovative implementation using techniques from the semantic web community such as ontology modeling and SPARQL. A stepwise example of modeling a commonly encountered AmI scenario showcases the expressiveness of our approach.

          "Abstract": "Nature is amazing and it provides inspiration for computer scientists in the most distinct ways. Swarm intelligence is a good example of this. As Gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka once said, \u201cThe whole is other than the sum of the parts\u201d. Swarm intelligence goes along the same line of thinking; it is linked to group intelligence behavior, how smart the collective behavior is and how the behavior of each individual member contributes to the whole. Sometimes, the synergy between members of one group, e.g. the collective behaviors of social insects such as ants and bees, presents an intelligence that goes far beyond the intelligence of each of its members. Some researchers even consider the collective, the swarm, as one single and unique individual. This individual can perform actions, or exhibit a behavior, that the individual members of the group alone would not be able to do. The main characteristic of swarm intelligence algorithms is that they automatically evolve by stimulating the social behavior of organisms. By sharing information and taking the information of others into account, the behavior of the individuals is optimized to achieve a certain objective, which is normally much higher than the individual actions of the members of the group.",

Companies producing carbon emissions must effectively manage associated costs by buying or selling carbon emission futures. Viewed from this perspective, this paper provides a model for managing the risk by buying and selling carbon emission futures by implementing techniques that leverage computational intelligence. Three computational intelligence techniques are proposed to provide accurate and timely forecasts for changes in the price of carbon: a novel hybrid neuro-fuzzy controller that forms a closed-loop feedback mechanism called PATSOS; an artificial neural network (ANN) based system; an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Results are based on 1074 daily carbon price observations collected to comprise a useful time-series dataset and for evaluation of the proposed techniques. The extra-sample performance of the proposed techniques is calculated. Analysis results are compared with those produced by other models. Comparison studies reveal that PATSOS is the most accurate and promising methodology for predicting the price of carbon. It is stated that this paper registers a first attempt to apply a hybrid neuro-fuzzy controller to forecasting carbon prices.",

          "Abstract": "Understanding the evolution and emergence of technology domains remains a challenge, particularly so for potentially breakthrough technologies. Though it is well recognized that emergence of new fields is complex and uncertain, to make decisions amidst such uncertainty, one needs to mobilize various sources of intelligence to identify known\u2013knowns and known\u2013unknowns to be able to choose appropriate strategies and policies. This competitive technical intelligence cannot rely on simple trend analyses because breakthrough technologies have little past to inform such trends, and positing the directions of evolution is challenging. Neither do qualitative tools, embracing the complexities, provide all the solutions, since transparent and repeatable techniques need to be employed to create best practices and evaluate the intelligence that comes from such exercises. In this paper, we present a hybrid roadmapping technique that draws on a number of approaches and integrates them into a multi-level approach (individual activities, industry evolutions and broader global changes) that can be applied to breakthrough technologies. We describe this approach in deeper detail through a case study on dye-sensitized solar cells. Our contribution to this special issue is to showcase the technique as part of a family of approaches that are emerging around the world to inform strategy and policy.",

We view this problem as a link-prediction task in a knowledge graph, and present a discriminative path-based method for fact checking in knowledge graphs that incorporates connectivity, type information, and predicate interactions. Given a statement Sof the form (subject, predicate, object), for example, (Chicago, capitalOf, Illinois), our approach mines discriminative paths that alternatively define the generalized statement (U.S. city, predicate, U.S. state) and uses the mined rules to evaluate the veracity of statement S . We evaluate our approach by examining thousands of claims related to history, geography, biology, and politics using a public, million node knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and PubMedDB. Not only does our approach significantly outperform related models, we also find that the discriminative predicate path model is easily interpretable and provides sensible reasons for the final determination.",

          "Abstract": "Personalization is the process of fitting a model to patient data, a critical step towards application of multi-physics computational models in clinical practice. Designing robust personalization algorithms is often a tedious, time-consuming, model- and data-specific process. We propose to use artificial intelligence concepts to learn this task, inspired by how human experts manually perform it. The problem is reformulated in terms of reinforcement learning. In an off-line phase, Vito, our self-taught artificial agent, learns a representative decision process model through exploration of the computational model: it learns how the model behaves under change of parameters. The agent then automatically learns an optimal strategy for on-line personalization. The algorithm is model-independent; applying it to a new model requires only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the observations to match. The full knowledge of the model itself is not required. Vito was tested in a synthetic scenario, showing that it could learn how to optimize cost functions generically. Then Vito was applied to the inverse problem of cardiac electrophysiology and the personalization of a whole-body circulation model. The obtained results suggested that Vito could achieve equivalent, if not better goodness of fit than standard methods, while being more robust (up to 11% higher success rates) and with faster (up to seven times) convergence rate. Our artificial intelligence approach could thus make personalization algorithms generalizable and self-adaptable to any patient and any model.",

          "Abstract": "Green logistics (GL) is gaining increasing attention among academic researchers and industrial practitioners, due to the escalating deterioration of the environment. Various green activities and operations aiming at improving the performance of GL have been applied synthetically, and most of the activities can be modeled as combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Exact approaches tend to be incapable of solving the CO problems, especially with the increasing complexity. Thus, meta-heuristic approaches are widely adopted, which can generate a satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. Swarm intelligence (SI) is an innovative branch of meta-heuristics derived from imitating the behavioral pattern of natural insects. The distributed control mechanism and simple interactive rules can manage the swarm of insects effectively and efficiently. There are some pilot studies in applying SI into GL, which indicates that the integration of GL and SI could be a promising choice and of great potential. This research reviews the application of SI in GL through a comprehensive and extensive investigation and analysis of extant literature, which includes 115 publications in the last twenty years. The integration of GL and SI is analyzed from the perspective of both the problem context and the methodology. The categories of GL and SI are classified systematically. The CO problems of GL are further studied with SI algorithms, and innovative and universal guidance for algorithm customization in resolving CO problems emerges as well. Further potential research issues and opportunities of GL and SI are also identified in this research.",

          "Abstract": "Five AI models are presented to model the dynamic nonlinear behavior of Buckling-Restrained Braces (BRBs). The AI techniques utilized in the models are: Time-Delayed Neural Networks (TDNN), Nonlinear Auto-Regressive eXogenous (NARX) neural networks, Gaussian-Mixture Models Regression (GMMR), Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) and Polynomial Classifier Regression (PCR). The models are developed using time-delayed brace displacements inputs and brace force outputs to predict updated brace forces during load reversals. The training and testing of the AI models are performed using experimental data from BRB specimens tested at the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center. The training stage for every method makes use of the experimental data from one specimen. In order to assess the models\u2019 learning and generalization capabilities, three sets of experimental data for different specimens are used. To arrive at an optimized architecture that best models the phenomenon, the model performance with different parameters is evaluated. The brace force predicted by the proposed model shows excellent resemblance to the experimental results for the training sample, for all techniques. The predicted behavior of the testing samples shows noticeable accuracy and further demonstrates the generalization and prediction capability of the proposed modeling techniques. The various techniques are compared on the basis of selected performance criteria. It is found that the performance of two AI techniques standout among the others: the NARX and the PCR. Although the NARX demonstrates a slight advantage in the prediction accuracy over the PCR, the latter is far more superior in terms of computational efficiency. Thus, the PCR would be recommended for scenarios where online training is needed. The BRB design and performance investigation processes can be facilitated by the developed modeling techniques thus minimizing the need for, and extent of, experimental testing.",

          "Abstract": "Wind-generated wave energy is a renewable energy source that exhibits a huge potential for sustainable growth. The design and deployment of wave energy converters at a given location require the prediction of the amount of available wave energy flux. This and other wave parameters can be estimated by means of Computational Intelligence techniques (Neural, Fuzzy, and Evolutionary Computation). This paper reviews those used in wave energy applications, both in the resource estimation and in the design and control of wave energy converters. In particular, most of the applications of Neural Computation techniques, considered here in a broad sense, focus on the prediction of a variety of wave energy parameters by means of Multilayer Perceptrons and, at a lesser extent, by Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Learning Machines. Fuzzy Computation is also applied to estimate wave parameters and control floating wave energy converter. Evolutionary Computation algorithms are used to estimate parameters and design wave energy collectors. We complete this paper with a case study that illustrates, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the potential of hybridizing a Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm with an Extreme Learning Machine to tackle the problem of significant wave height reconstruction.",

          "Abstract": "Financial markets play an important role on the economical and social organization of modern society. In these kinds of markets, information is an invaluable asset. However, with the modernization of the financial transactions and the information systems, the large amount of information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of a financial asset. In the last decades, many researchers have attempted to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support the decision-making in different financial market segments. In the literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial market problems. However, only few studies have focused on review the literature of this topic. Most of the existing review articles have a limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms. This paper presents a review of the application of several computational intelligent methods in several financial applications. This paper gives an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to 2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining financial text information, among others. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature of this field, (ii) the definition of a systematic procedure for guiding the task of building an intelligent trading system and (iii) a discussion about the main challenges and open problems in this scientific field.",

          "Abstract": "The design of low-power scalable wireless sensor networks remains a key challenge of the research. Clustering and routing have been widely studied for extending the lifetime of a network, which is a critical issue in sensor networks. Routing involves non-negligible operations, which considerably affect the network lifetime and the throughput. The clustering technique with data aggregation on cluster heads has an influence on the overall performance of the network since it is favoring a maximum network lifetime. This paper presents a novel cluster-based routing protocol called ABC-SD. The proposed protocol exploits the biologically inspired fast and efficient searching features of the Artificial Bee Colony metaheuristic to build low-power clusters. For the choice of cluster heads, a multi-objective fitness function is designed by using a Linear Programming formulation. The routing problem is addressed by a cost-based function that makes a trade-off between the energy efficiency and the number of hops of the path. The clustering process is achieved at the Base Station with a centralized control algorithm, which exploits energy levels and the neighborhood information of location-unaware sensors. As for the routing of gathered data, it is realized in a distributed manner. Furthermore, unlike the existing protocols in the literature, a realistic energy model is adopted in the considered network model. The proposed protocol is intensively experimented with a number of topologies in various network scenarios and the results are compared with the well-known cluster-based routing protocols that include the swarm intelligence based protocols. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in terms of network lifetime, network coverage and the amount of packets delivered to the Base Station.",

In fact, the reverse may be the case. We demonstrate that under the dynamic conditions found in most financial markets, complex prediction models that seem, ex-ante, to be at least as good as more simple models, can underperform in out-of-sample tests. The correct application of these optimization methods requires a knowledge of how and when these techniques will yield beneficial outcomes.

We show the effectiveness of our model through an empirical analysis where three different contexts are considered: easy, challenging, and difficult problem cases.

          "Abstract": "The graph coloring problem is one of the combinatorial optimization problems. Although many heuristics and metaheuristics algorithm were developed to solve graph coloring problem but they have some limitations in one way or another. In case of tabu search, the algorithm becomes slow, if the tabu list is big. This is because lots of memory to keep the list and also a lot of time to travel through the list, is needed in each step of the algorithm. Simulated annealing has a big handicap when applied to graph coloring problem because there are lots of neighboring states that have the same energy value. The problem with ant colony optimization is that the number of ants that must be checked is n times bigger than other algorithms. Therefore, there will be a need of a large amount of memory and the computational time of this algorithm can be very large. A swarm intelligence based technique called as particle swarm optimization is therefore employed to solve the graph coloring problem. Particle swarm optimization is simple and powerful technique but its main drawback is its ability of being trapped in the local optimum. Therefore, to overcome this, an efficient Acceleration based Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) is introduced in this paper. Empirical study of the proposed APSO algorithm is performed on the second DIMACS challenge benchmarks. The APSO results are compared with the standard PSO algorithm and experimental results validates the superiority of the proposed APSO.",

In this study, an adapted version of ABC, ABC binfor short, is proposed for binary optimization. In the proposed model for solving binary optimization problems, despite the fact that artificial agents in the algorithm works on the continuous solution space, the food source position obtained by the artificial agents is converted to binary values, before the objective function specific for the problem is evaluated. The accuracy and performance of the proposed approach have been examined on well-known 15 benchmark instances of uncapacitated facility location problem, and the results obtained by ABC binare compared with the results of continuous particle swarm optimization (CPSO), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), improved binary particle swarm optimization (IBPSO), binary artificial bee colony algorithm (binABC) and discrete artificial bee colony algorithm (DisABC). The performance of ABC binis also analyzed under the change of control parameter values.

          "Abstract": "Knowledge acquisition still represents one of the main challenging obstacles to designing intelligent systems exhibiting human-level performance in complex intelligent tasks. The recent developments in crowdsourcing technologies have opened new promising opportunities to overcome this problem by exploiting large amounts of machine readable knowledge to perform tasks requiring human intelligence. Wikipedia is a case of this research trend, being the largest collaborative and multilingual resource and linguistic knowledge that contains unstructured and semi-structured information. In this paper, we propose an approach for deriving \u201cis a\u201d taxonomy from the Wikipedia Categories Graph (WCG), which is an open collaborative resource. After building and filtering the WCG from a Wikipedia dump, the process would mainly consist in the exploitation of the \u201cBY\u201d tag and the sharing of plural headers. These methods provide a graph formed by a set of non-connected sub-graphs. Therefore, we propose a process for linking them to finally obtain an \u201cis a\u201d taxonomy with only one root and modeled as a direct acyclic graph (DAG). In this work, specific DAG handling algorithms are used, including an algorithm for a DAG into sub-DAGs and another for merging two DAGs. The obtained taxonomy is assessed using semantic similarity measures, which consist in quantifying the likeness between two concepts or words. Therefore, we exploit a set of well-known benchmarks to compare the results obtained via the generated taxonomy to those achieved with WordNet, a resource created and maintained by domain experts. The experimental results revealed good correlations between computed values and human judgments. Compared to WordNet, the derived taxonomy was also noted to lead to an enhanced coverage capacity.",

This type of mill is generally used for moderate milling of difficult-to-process and heat sensitive materials to a particle size range of c.a. 250\u03bcm. Particle size distribution is the result of interaction between ribbon properties and process conditions, therefore it is crucial to model and optimize such a complex process in order to produce more uniform particle size distributions. In this work, multiple linear regression (MLR), genetic programming (GP), and artificial Neural Networks (ANN) assisted by 3-fold cross-validation (CV) were used to present generalized models for the prediction of granule size based on the experimental data set. The normalized mean squared error (NRMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) for best fit, namely ANN model were obtained as follows: NRMSE=2.28%, R2 =0.9926. MLR model was imprecise in the prediction of d10 class. Due to its performance similarities to ANN and its transparency and ease of application, the GP model could be used widely for granule size prediction. Based on the results it was confirmed that the screen size has the most significant effect on the granule size distribution.",

The proposed tool allows medical professionals to easily manipulate and visualise queries and answers for making decisions during the practice of teleexpertise. The knowledge modelling is made using an open application programming interface (API) called CoGui, which offers the means for building structured knowledge bases with the dedicated functionalities of graph-based reasoning via retrieved data from different institutions (hospitals, national security centre, and nursing homes).

In this paper, we formulate a new approach for obtaining better learning paths for different learners groups as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) in which meta-data and competencies are used to define the relationships between the learning objects (LOs), where the course materials are used to formulate LOs sequence. The main aim of this paper is to obtain a dynamic learning path for the considered CSP problem by using the swarm intelligence technique, which is a sub-set of the artificial intelligence technique. Further, the proposed model is tested in a simulated environment, which gives an optimized LO sequencing. The simulation results reveal that the artificial ants gives solution to the proposed problem in an optimized way. More precisely, suitable learning path can be obtained by applying ant colony optimization (ACO) technique. From the obtained results it is concluded that the proposed model supports the e-learning portal administrator in getting benefits in terms of less processing time and minimal sequencing cost.",

This conception allows one to compose a diagnosis system that can continuously learn without reinitialization when new disturbances occur due to the evolution of the electrical system. Two artificial immune algorithms, which are the negative selection algorithm and the clonal selection algorithm, are used for the pattern recognition process and the learning process, respectively. The principal application of this new method aids the operation during failures, supervises the protection system, and can evolve with the power systems to continuously acquire new knowledge. This new methodology has a direct impact in the area of diagnosis in electrical systems, as well as, in the pattern recognition problem, because the main contribution and novelty of this method is the continuous learning capability, which enables the system to learn unknown patterns without having to restart the knowledge. This is the major advantage of this methodology. To evaluate the efficiency and performance of this new method, failure simulations were performed in a real distribution system with 134 buses using the EMTP software. The results show robustness and efficiency.",

Therefore, a computational model of the reality can be built and processed by Artificial Intelligence algorithms to infer knowledge, make decisions, etc. In this work, the design of a hardware component to accelerate reasoning operations on semantic trees by means of an FPGA based platform is presented. The target application is common-sense reasoning where marker-passing algorithms work on semantic tree structures; the core of the Scone Knowledge-Based system.On top of the functionality to be implemented, a strategy to deal with the implementation in reconfigurable hardware of dynamic and recursive data structures has been envisioned. Since lists, graphs or trees are the cornerstone in the modelling of computer friendly solutions for complex problems; this proposal contributes to reduce the breach between the software and silicon domains.As a result, an optimized micro-architecture of an FPGA accelerator for marker-passer algorithms integrated into a heterogeneous computing platform, and a smart data mapping procedure have been delivered. The design has been prototyped on a Xilinx ML507 board and compared to an equivalent software implementation, showing a significant reduction in execution times.",

Method Nodes of Knowledge (NOK) is one of the methods which allows a graphical representation and organization of knowledge in the form of a DNOK diagram (Diagram of Nodes Of Knowledge) as a network of nodes. With this diagram the meaning of sentences is preserved. The problem occurs when words that have synonyms or homonyms, and whose meaning depends on the context, appear in the sentence which is being modeled. Every term used in modeling sentences is written in a dictionary, including homonyms and synonyms. This paper presents a metamodel mode of writing homonyms and synonyms into the dictionary from which words are used for modeling. This demonstrates that the NOK method can be applied to modeling dictionaries of natural languages.",

          "Abstract": "The lexicographic bottleneck assembly line balancing problem is a recently introduced problem which aims at obtaining a smooth workload distribution among workstations. This is achieved hierarchically. The workload of the most heavily loaded workstation is minimised, followed by the workload of the second most heavily loaded workstation and so on. This study contributes to knowledge by examining the application of the lexicographic bottleneck objective on mixed-model lines, where more than one product model is produced in an inter-mixed sequence. The main characteristics of the lexicographic bottleneck mixed-model assembly line balancing problem are described with numerical examples. Another contribution of the study is the methodology used to deal with the complex structure of the problem. Two effective meta-heuristic approaches, namely artificial bee colony and tabu search, are proposed. The parameters of the proposed meta-heuristics are optimised using response surface methodology, which is a well-known design of experiments technique, as a unique contribution to the expert and intelligent systems literature. Different from the common tendency in the literature (which aims to optimise one parameter at a time), all parameters are optimised simultaneously. Therefore, it is shown how a complex production planning problem can be solved using sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques with optimised parameters. The methodology used for parameter setting can be applied to other metaheuristics for solving complex problems in practice. The performances of both algorithms are assessed using well-known test problems and it is observed that both algorithms find promising solutions. Artificial bee colony algorithm outperforms tabu search in minimising the number of workstations while tabu search shows a better performance in minimising the value of lexicographic bottleneck objective function.",

          "Abstract": "Quantifying semantic similarity between linguistic items lies at the core of many applications in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. It has therefore received a considerable amount of research interest, which in its turn has led to a wide range of approaches for measuring semantic similarity. However, these measures are usually limited to handling specific types of linguistic item, e.g., single word senses or entire sentences. Hence, for a downstream application to handle various types of input, multiple measures of semantic similarity are needed, measures that often use different internal representations or have different output scales. In this article we present a unified graph-based approach for measuring semantic similarity which enables effective comparison of linguistic items at multiple levels, from word senses to full texts. Our method first leverages the structural properties of a semantic network in order to model arbitrary linguistic items through a unified probabilistic representation, and then compares the linguistic items in terms of their representations. We report state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets pertaining to three different levels: senses, words, and texts.",

          "Abstract": "Surface phenomena such as corrosion, crystal growth, catalysis, adsorption and oxidation cannot be adequately comprehended without the full knowledge of surface energy of the concerned material. Despite these significances of surface energy, they are difficult to obtain experimentally and the few available ones are subjected to certain degree of inaccuracies due to extrapolation of surface tension to 0K. In order to cater for these difficulties, we have developed a model using computational intelligence technique on the platform of support vector regression (SVR) to establish a database of surface energies of hexagonal close packed metals (HCP). The SVR based-model was developed through training and testing SVR using fourteen experimental data of periodic metals. The developed model shows accuracy of 99.08% and 100% during training and testing phase, respectively, using test-set cross validation technique. The developed model was further used to obtain surface energies of HCP metals. The surface energies obtained from SVR-based model are closer to the experimental values than the results of the well-known existing theoretical models. The outstanding performance of this developed model in estimating surface energies of HCP metals with high degree of accuracy, in the presence of few experimental data, is a great achievement in the field of surface science because of its potential to circumvent experimental difficulties in determining surface energies of materials.",

Due to distortions of the data and the complexity of the problem, in some applications, completely automatic processes do not return a satisfactory graph matching. We propose a method to perform active and interactive graph matching in which an active module queries one of the nodes of the graphs and the oracle (human or artificial) returns the node of the other graph it has to be mapped with. The interactive algorithm reaches the matching desired by the user in few interactions, since by imposing a node-to-node mapping, other ones are automatically amended. The method uses any graph matching algorithm that iteratively updates a probability matrix between nodes since it only requires access to the probability matrix and to update the costs between nodes and arcs. We present and practically validate different active strategies.",

          "Abstract": "The mind is a biological phenomenon. Thus, biological principles of organization should also be the principles underlying mental operations. Practopoiesis states that the key for achieving intelligence through adaptation is an arrangement in which mechanisms laying at a lower level of organization, by their operations and interaction with the environment, enable creation of mechanisms laying at a higher level of organization. When such an organizational advance of a system occurs, it is called a traverse. A case of traverse is when plasticity mechanisms (at a lower level of organization), by their operations, create a neural network anatomy (at a higher level of organization). Another case is the actual production of behavior by that network, whereby the mechanisms of neuronal activity operate to create motor actions. Practopoietic theory explains why the adaptability of a system increases with each increase in the number of traverses. With a larger number of traverses, a system can be relatively small and yet, produce a higher degree of adaptive/intelligent behavior than a system with a lower number of traverses. The present analyses indicate that the two well-known traverses \u2013 neural plasticity and neural activity \u2013 are not sufficient to explain human mental capabilities. At least one additional traverse is needed, which is named anapoiesis for its contribution in reconstructing knowledge e.g., from long-term memory into working memory. The conclusions bear implications for brain theory, the mind\u2013body explanatory gap, and developments of artificial intelligence technologies.",

This paper describes a knowledge capture approach and a supporting graphical tool that together allow for direct acquisition of team mental models in the form of conceptual graphs. We performed acquisition experiments on over one hundred teams where team members used the tool to specify their team process. In addition to acquiring team members' models, non-team observers created \u201cexpert\u201d models of the team process for comparison. We obtained good results on accepted measures of recall and precision compared to the \u201cexpert\u201d models.",

After a short review of the theoretical approaches to emotions and their role in the educational process, we focus on the use of artificial emotions for pedagogical agents, which can bring benefits to the educational process. An emotional pedagogical agent can encourage a student to care more about her/his own progress. It can also pass enthusiasm on to a student and can make studying fun. The main problem is how to implement the artificial emotions and moods. We present our personal approach and implementation at the end of the chapter.",

          "Abstract": "Advances in computing technology have been instrumental in creating an assortment of powerful information visualization techniques. However, the selection of a suitable and effective visualization technique for a specific dataset and a data mining task is not trivial. This work automatically selects an appropriate visualization technique based on the given metadata and the task that a user intends to perform. The appropriate visualization is predicted based on an artificial neural network (ANN)-based model which classifies the input data into one of the eight predefined classes. A purpose built dataset extracted from the existing knowledge in the discipline is utilized to train the neural network. The dataset covers eight visualization techniques, including: histogram, line chart, pie chart, scatter plot, parallel coordinates, map, treemap, and linked graph. Various architectures using different numbers of hidden units, hidden layers, and input and output data formats have been evaluated to find the optimal neural network architecture. The performance of neural networks is measured using: confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the classification. Optimal neural network architecture is determined by convergence time and number of iterations. The results obtained from the best ANN architecture are compared with five other classifiers, k-nearest neighbor, na\u00efve Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine. The proposed system outperforms four classifiers in terms of accuracy and all five classifiers based on execution time. The trained neural network is also tested on twenty real-world benchmark datasets, where the proposed approach also provides two alternate visualizations, in addition to the most suitable one, for a particular dataset. A qualitative comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches is also presented. The results show that the proposed technique assists in selecting an appropriate visualization technique for a given dataset with high accuracy.",

          "Abstract": "What are the most relevant factors to be considered by employees when searching for an employer? The answer to this question poses valuable knowledge from the Business Intelligence viewpoint since it allows companies to retain personnel and attract competent employees. It leads to an increase in sales of their products or services, therefore remaining competitive across similar companies in the market. In this paper we assess the attractiveness of companies in Belgium by using a new two-stage methodology based on Artificial Intelligence techniques. The proposed method allows constructing high-quality prototypes from partial rankings indicating experts\u2019 preferences. Being more explicit, in the first step we propose a fuzzy clustering algorithm for partial rankings called fuzzy c-aggregation. This algorithm is based on the well-known fuzzy c-means procedure and uses the Hausdorff distance as dissimilarity functional and a counting strategy for updating the center of each cluster. However, we cannot ensure the optimality of such prototypes, and therefore more accurate prototypes must be derived. That is why the second step is focused on solving the extended Kemeny ranking problem for each discovered cluster taking into account the estimated membership matrix. To accomplish that, we adopt an optimization method based on Swarm Intelligence that exploits a colony of artificial ants. Several simulations show the effectiveness of the proposal for the real-world problem under investigation.",

          "Abstract": "Execution of complex analytic queries on massive semantic graphs is a challenging problem in big-data analytics that requires high-performance parallel computing. In a semantic graph, vertices and edges carry attributes of various types and the analytic queries typically depend on the values of these attributes. Thus, the computation must view the graph through a filter that passes only those individual vertices and edges of interest. Previous investigations have developed Knowledge Discovery Toolbox (KDT), a sophisticated Python library for parallel graph computations. In KDT, the user can write custom graph algorithms by specifying operations between edges and vertices (semiring operations). The user can also customize existing graph algorithms by writing filters. Although the high-level language for this customization enables domain scientists to productively express their graph analytics requirements, the customized queries perform poorly due to the overhead of having to call into the Python virtual machine for each vertex and edge.In this work, we use the Selective Embedded Just-In-Time Specialization (SEJITS) approach to automatically translate semiring operations and filters defined by programmers into a lower-level efficiency language, bypassing the upcall into Python. We evaluate our approach by comparing it with the high-performance Combinatorial BLAS engine and show that our approach combines the benefits of programming in a high-level language with executing in a low-level parallel environment. We increase the system\u2019s flexibility by developing techniques that provide users with the ability to define new vertex and edge types from Python. We also present a new Roofline model for graph traversals and show that we achieve performance that is significantly closer to the bounds suggested by the Roofline. Finally, to further understand the complex interaction with the underlying architecture, we present an analysis using performance counters that quantifies the improvement in hardware behavior in the context our SEJITS methodology. Overall, we demonstrate the first known solution to the problem of obtaining high performance from a productivity language when applying graph algorithms selectively on semantic graphs with hundreds of millions of edges and scaling to thousands of processors for graphs.",

We present an algebraic graph theoretic approach that uses graph topological invariants for quantification of ultraprecision surface morphology. The graph theoretic approach captures heterogeneous multi-scaled aspects of surface morphology from optical micrographs, and is therefore valuable for in situ real-time assessment of surface quality. Extensive experimental investigations with specular finished (Sa \u223c 5nm) blanket copper wafers from a chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) process suggest that the proposed method was able to quantify and track variations in surface morphology more effectively than statistical quantifiers reported in literature.",

          "Abstract": "Polymeric materials, being capable of high mouldability, usability of long lifetime up to 50 years and availability at low cost properties compared to metallic materials, are in demand but finite element-based design engineers have limited means in terms of the limited material data and mathematical models. In particular, in the analysis of products with complex geometry, the stresses and strains of various amounts formed in the product should be known and evaluated in terms of a precise design of the product to fulfil life expectancy. Due to time and cost constraints, experimental data cannot be available for all cases required in analysis, therefore, finite element method-based simulations are commonly used by design engineers. This is also computationally expensive and requires a simpler and more precise way to complete the design more realistically. In this study, the whole creep behaviour of polypropylene for all stresses were obtained with 10% accuracy errors by artificial neural networks trained using existing experimental test results of the materials for a particular working range. The artificial neural network model was trained with traditional as well as heuristic based methods. It is demonstrated that heuristically trained ANN models have provided much accurate and precise results, which are in line with 10% accuracy of experimental data.",

In such applications, the notion of relatedness between entities plays an important role whenever, given a query, we are looking not only for exact answers but we are also interested in a ranked list of related ones. In this paper we present an approach to build a relatedness graph among resources in the DBpedia dataset that refer to the IT domain. Our final aim is to create a useful data structure at the basis of an expert system that, looking for an IT resource, returns a ranked list of related technologies, languages, tools the user might be interested in. The graph we created is a basic building block to allow an expert system to support the user in entity search tasks in the IT domain (e.g. software component search or expert finding) that goes beyond string matching typical of pure keyword-based approaches and is able to exploit the explicit and implicit semantics encoded within LOD datasets. The graph creation relies on different relatedness measures that are combined with each other to compute a ranked list of candidate resources associated to a given query. We validated our tool through experimental evaluation on real data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In this work, we develop and compare several integer linear programming techniques and heuristic methods. Random graphs are used for the purpose of comparison.

Hence, power system control and the energy business require the prediction of solar energy (radiation) from a few seconds up to one week in advance. To deal with prediction shortcomings, various solar radiation prediction methods have been used. Predictive data mining offers variety of methods for solar radiation predictions where artificial neural network is one of the reliable and accurate methods. A systematic review of literature was conducted and identified 24 papers that discuss artificial neural network for solar systems design and solar radiation prediction. The artificial neural network techniques were employed for designing solar systems and predicting solar radiations to assess current literature on the basis of prediction accuracy and inadequacies. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria in two distinct rounds were applied to determine the most relevant studies for our research goal. Further, it is observed from the result of this study that artificial neural network gives good accuracy in terms of prediction error less than 20%. The accuracy of solar radiation prediction models is found to be dependent on input parameters and architecture type algorithms utilized. Therefore, artificial neural network as compared to other empirical models is capable to deal with many input meteorological parameters, which make it more accurate and reliable.",

The technique was applied with the involved people in the lithographic process in a Metallurgical Company located in southern Brazil. Knowledge of two production coordinators were modeled. For the process of knowledge acquisition and mapping of attributes and values to feed the knowledge base of an expert system, were used quality tools such as Brainstorming, Pareto Chart and Ishikawa Diagram associated with knowledge elicitation techniques such as unstructured interview, rating chips, observation technique, limitation of information and protocol analysis. Quality tools and techniques of knowledge elicitation were systematized to promote process mapping and the elicitation of tacit knowledge, with the aim of representing knowledge by means of production rules. We constructed two knowledge bases with the same methods of production, one in a non-probabilistic expert system (knowledge-based system) and the other in a probabilistic expert system (Bayesian networks) in order to perform comparisons and simulations of the results found. Expert systems perform systematic analysis from the answers given by those involved in lithographic labels process while the defect is identified in order to support the user in diagnosing the root cause of the failure process. From simulations of changes in process variables was possible to prove the hypothesis of the use of probabilistic expert system as industrial support tool in preventing the occurrence of defects in the process and result in a productivity gain.",

          "Abstract": "Archaeologists continue to search for techniques that enable them to analyze archaeological data efficiently with artificial intelligence approaches increasingly employed to create new knowledge from archaeological data. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the application of Pattern Recognition methods in detection of buried archaeological sites of the semi-arid Khorramabad Plain located in west Iran. This environment has provided suitable conditions for human habitation for over 40,000years. However, environmental changes in the late Pleistocene and Holocene have caused erosion and sedimentation resulting in burial of some archaeological sites making archaeological landscape reconstructions more challenging. In this paper, the environmental variables that have influenced formation of archaeological sites of the Khorramabad Plain are identified through the application of Arc GIS. These variables are utilized to create an accurate predictive model based on the application of One-Class classification Pattern Recognition techniques. These techniques can be built using data from one class only, when the data from other classes are difficult to obtain, and are highly suitable in this context. The experimental results of this paper confirm one-class classifiers, including Auto-encoder Neural Network, k-means, principal component analysis data descriptor, minimum spanning tree data descriptor, k-nearest neighbour and Gaussian distribution as promising applications in creating an effective model for detecting buried archaeological sites. Among the investigated classifiers, minimum spanning tree data descriptor achieved the best performance on the Khorramabad Plain data set.",

          "Abstract": "Behavior planning is known to be one of the basic cognitive functions, which is essential for any cognitive architecture of any control system used in robotics. At the same time most of the widespread planning algorithms employed in those systems are developed using only approaches and models of Artificial Intelligence and don't take into account numerous results of cognitive experiments. As a result, there is a strong need for novel methods of behavior planning suitable for modern cognitive architectures aimed at robot control. One such method is presented in this work and is studied within a special class of navigation task called smart relocation task. The method is based on the hierarchical two-level model of abstraction and knowledge representation, e.g. symbolic and subsymbolic. On the symbolic level sign world model is used for knowledge representation and hierarchical planning algorithm, MAP, is utilized for planning. On the subsymbolic level the task of path planning is considered and solved as a graph search problem. Interaction between both planners is examined and inter-level interfaces and feedback loops are described. Preliminary experimental results are presented.",

The important role of the human factor in the problems related to conduct industrial processes is indisputable and is justified by a greater diversity of research. Indeed, the consideration of the human characteristics is essential to enhance the factory performance. Particularly, reuse of human knowledge is an element which plays an essential role in the continuous improvement of maintenance activities. In this context, we are interested to the problem of selection of experts in maintenance process. We propose, in this paper, a new approach to formalize knowledge as first step to solve the experts' selection problem under the previous experience. In that purpose, this paper takes domain ontology as a framework, the experience feedback models used to select experts, in the purpose to collaborate the interactions between them as a team that is capable of making decision in a fault diagnosis/repair situation based not only on skills but also according to the previous experience and CMDO ontology as the knowledge domain.",

We introduce design principles to implement these theoretical ideas. Our agent's input data is not a direct function of the environment's state as it is in most symbolic or reinforcement-learning models. The agent is designed to discover and learn regularities in its stream of experience and to construct knowledge about phenomena whose hypothetical presence in the environment explains these regularities. We report a proof-of-concept experiment in which the agent constructs categories of phenomena, and exploits this knowledge to satisfy innate preferences. This work suggests a new approach to cognitive modeling that focuses on the agent's internal stream of experience. We argue that this approach complies with theories of embodied cognition and enaction.",

          "Abstract": "Feature selection is an important preprocessing step in machine learning and pattern recognition. The ultimate goal of feature selection is to select a feature subset from the original feature set to increase the performance of learning algorithms. In this paper a novel feature selection method based on the graph clustering approach and ant colony optimization is proposed for classification problems. The proposed method\u2019s algorithm works in three steps. In the first step, the entire feature set is represented as a graph. In the second step, the features are divided into several clusters using a community detection algorithm and finally in the third step, a novel search strategy based on the ant colony optimization is developed to select the final subset of features. Moreover the selected subset of each ant is evaluated using a supervised filter based method called novel separability index. Thus the proposed method does not need any learning model and can be classified as a filter based feature selection method. The proposed method integrates the community detection algorithm with a modified ant colony based search process for the feature selection problem. Furthermore, the sizes of the constructed subsets of each ant and also size of the final feature subset are determined automatically. The performance of the proposed method has been compared to those of the state-of-the-art filter and wrapper based feature selection methods on ten benchmark classification problems. The results show that our method has produced consistently better classification accuracies.",

          "Abstract": "The interpretation of diagnostic images is often conditioned by the specific properties of the instrument that generated the image. This makes particularly complicated to develop universal recognition algorithms that can facilitate the diagnosis in case of massive population screenings. Mammography is a typical example where such an algorithm is required. Although the technological advances in medical imaging increases the accuracy of interpretation of images, the improved resolution may not facilitate the identification of breast cancer at a very early stage due to the many confounding factors related, for instance, to differences in instrument settings or breast positioning by the operator. Being impossible an exact standardization, the problem of reducing the effects of different instruments and operators can be faced with a proper algorithm that can extract from each image the relevant information in an unsupervised manner, thus limiting the influence of instrumental and positioning issues. For this scope, in this paper we investigated the properties of a classifier based on an ensemble of Adaptive Artificial Immune Networks (A2INET) applied to original mammography image indicators aimed at diagnosing bilateral asymmetry that is known to be correlated with increased breast cancer risk. Classification models were trained using a set of descriptors measuring the degree of similarity of paired regions of the left and right breasts. Noteworthy, the ensemble of A2INET models achieved very high classification rates even when training and testing were made on two completely independent and heterogeneous datasets. The obtained results are promising (maximum accuracy level of 0.90, sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.87) and they prefigure to apply automatic diagnostic tools in clinical practice exploiting a network of different instrument databases.",

Central to our work is a model that quantifies the relationship of two data points by their pairwise modular value. A larger value indicates a higher chance that they should be placed near to each other, and vice versa. The objective function of the model has a simple formulation of minimizing the sum of squared distances between data points weighted by pairwise modular values. It is naturally relaxed as a semi-definite program that learns a low-rank kernel matrix with only one linear constraint, which can be solved efficiently by modern mathematical optimization solvers. Compared with traditional graph embedding algorithms, the proposed method is shown to be able to highlight cluster structures inherent in high-dimensional data and graphs, which provides a promising tool in data analysis applications.",

          "Abstract": "Many synthetic composite indicators have been developed with the aim to measure micro- and macro-knowledge competitiveness, however, without any unified, easy to visualise and assessable forecasting capability, their benefits to decision makers remain limited. In this article, a new framework for forecasting knowledge based economy (KBE) competitiveness is proposed. Existing KBE indicators from internationally recognised organisations are used to forecast and unify the KBE performance indices. Three different forecasting methods including time-series cross sectional (TSCS) (also known as panel data), linear multiple regression (LMREG), and artificial neural network (ANN) are employed. The ANN forecasting model outperformed the TSCS and LMREG. The proposed KBE hybrid forecasting model utilises a 2-stage ANN model which is fed with a panel data set structure. The first stage of the model consists of a feed-forward neural network that feeds to a Kohonen's self-organising map (SOM) in the second stage of the model. A feed-forward neural network is used to learn and predict the scores of nations using past observed data. Then, a SOM is used to aggregate the forecasted scores and to place nations in homogeneous clusters. The proposed framework can be applied in the context of forecasting and producing a unified meaningful map that places any KBE in its homogeneous league, even when considering a limited data set.",

We model the problem as a combination of two coupled sub-problems. One sub-problem is a charge scheduling problem in a hybrid flowshop, and the other is a cast scheduling problem in parallel machines. To solve this SCC problem, we present a novel cooperative co-evolutionary artificial bee colony (CCABC) algorithm that has two sub-swarms, with each addressing a sub-problem. Problem-specific knowledge is used to construct an initial population, and an exploration strategy is introduced to guide the CCABC to promising regions during the search. To adapt the search operators in the classical artificial bee colony (ABC) to the cooperative co-evolution paradigm, an enhanced strategy for onlookers and a self-adaptive neighbourhood operator have been suggested. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world instances from an SCC process show the effectiveness of the proposed CCABC in solving the SCC scheduling problem.",

Our goal is to allow the users to interact with the system using other languages different from the one used to train the semantic models, avoiding the cost of segmenting and labeling a training corpus for each language. In order to reduce the effect of translation errors and to increase the coverage, we propose an algorithm to generate graphs of words from different translations.

          "Abstract": "The use of argument diagrams to foster argumentation has been an object of research in education, as a way to support student\u015b argumentative interaction and, potentially, learning. In this paper it is shown how argument analysis and evaluation assisted by means of argument diagramming tools, further developed in artificial intelligence (AI), can also support the assessment of argumentation skills in the classroom. A case study is presented to show how informal logic contributions on fallacies, in particular, can be combined with the data of an argument-diagramming task, to form a method of assessing students\u2019 weaknesses in reasoning about everyday issues using argument maps. Our contribution is mainly methodological, as we suggest an application of AI and argumentation theories in education.",

Principal component analysis was used to identify the components of firms\u2019 value co-creation activities and service value attributes; correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the degree of involvement in specific co-creation activities, the online articulation of firms\u2019 service value attributes and the perception of their innovativeness. K-means and self organizing map (SOM) are used to cluster firms with regards to their involvement in co-creation and new service development, and, additionally, as complementary tools for studying the relationship between co-creation and new service development.The results show that, first, there is a statistically significant relationship between firms\u2019 degree of involvement in co-creation activities and the degree of articulation of their service value attributes; second, the relationship should be considered within the context of firms\u2019 innovation activities; third, OS Software-driven firms are the best example in terms of co-creation and new product-enabled service development, i.e. the collaborative principles built in their customer participation platforms should be adopted by other (non-software) firms interested in enhancing their innovation capacity through involvement in co-creation and new product-enabled service development.",

          "Abstract": "This study proposes a novel binary version of the artificial bee colony algorithm based on genetic operators (GB-ABC) such as crossover and swap to solve binary optimization problems. Integrated to the neighbourhood searching mechanism of the basic ABC algorithm, the modification comprises four stages: (1) In neighbourhood of a (current) food source, randomly select two food sources from population and generate a solution including zeros (Zero) outside the population; (2) apply two-point crossover operator between the current, two neighbourhood, global best and Zero food sources to create children food sources; (3) apply swap operator to the children food sources to generate grandchildren food sources; and (4) select the best food source as a neighbourhood food source of the current solution among the children and grandchildren food sources. In this way, the global\u2013local search ability of the basic ABC algorithm is improved in binary domain. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm GB-ABC is tested on two well-known binary optimization problems: dynamic image clustering and 0\u20131 knapsack problems. The obtained results clearly indicate that GB-ABC is the most suitable algorithm in binary optimization when compared with the other well-known existing binary optimization algorithms. In addition, the achievement of the proposed algorithm is supported by applying it to the CEC2005 benchmark numerical problems.",

          "Abstract": "The sustainable development of agricultural regions requires a methodical approach that will make a viable land management system policy in practice. In this regard, distinctive contextual characteristics of a country (remarkable areas for raising the regional products) could be taken into account in order to promote the good character of agricultural outputs and to increase the added value of considered lands. The manuscript primarily describes in qualitative and quantitative terms a mechanism for synthesizing information about wine production characteristics and therefore provides sufficient substantive treatment of agricultural or other system interactions. Firstly, the manuscript presents a discussion about many factors that affect wine production, and secondly, the focus is more on the development of an integrated approach using numerical and symbolic reasoning. The Geoviticulture Multicriteria Climatic Classification (MCC) System is engaged with a methodology comprising three viticultural climatic indexes of different natures: hydric type (dryness index), heliothermal type (Huglin index), and Nictothermal type (Cold Night Index). The knowledge representation is symbolized with the conceptual graphs formalism and the reasoning mechanisms are based on graph operations. A visual reasoning development focuses more on the decision process that would seem more appropriate for a practice on decision support. In addition, the Decision Support System (DSS) component is illustrated with a case study of Croatia republic in very broad characterizations of its main regional grape varieties.",

          "Abstract": "Industrial robots are reliable machines for manufacturing tasks such as welding, panting, assembly, palletizing or kitting operations. They are traditionally programmed by an operator using a teach pendant in a point-to-point scheme with limited sensing capabilities such as industrial vision systems and force/torque sensing. The use of these sensing capabilities is associated to the particular robot controller, operative systems and programming language. Today, robots can react to environment changes specific to their task domain but are still unable to learn skills to effectively use their current knowledge. The need for such a skill in unstructured environments where knowledge can be acquired and enhanced is desirable so that robots can effectively interact in multimodal real-world scenarios.In this article we present a multimodal assembly controller (MAC) approach to embed and effectively enhance knowledge into industrial robots working in multimodal manufacturing scenarios such as assembly during kitting operations with varying shapes and tolerances. During learning, the robot uses its vision and force capabilities resembling a human operator carrying out the same operation. The approach consists of using a MAC based on the Fuzzy ARTMAP artificial neural network in conjunction with a knowledge base. The robot starts the operation having limited initial knowledge about what task it has to accomplish. During the operation, the robot learns the skill for recognising assembly parts and how to assemble them. The skill acquisition is evaluated by counting the steps to complete the assembly, length of the followed assembly path and compliant behaviour. The performance improves with time so that the robot becomes an expert demonstrated by the assembly of a kit with different part geometries. The kit is unknown by the robot at the beginning of the operation; therefore, the kit type, location and orientation are unknown as well as the parts to be assembled since they are randomly fed by a conveyor belt.",

          "Abstract": "Machine learning has a powerful potential for performing the template attack (TA) of cryptographic device. To improve the accuracy and time consuming of electromagnetic template attack (ETA), a multi-class directed acyclic graph support vector machine (DAGSVM) method is proposed to predict the Hamming weight of the key. The method needs to generate K(K1)/2 binary support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and realizes the K-class prediction using a rooted binary directed acyclic graph (DAG) testing model. Further, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used for optimal selection of DAGSVM model parameters to improve the performance of DAGSVM. By exploiting the electromagnetic emanations captured while a chip was implementing the RC4 algorithm in software, the computation complexity and performance of several multi-class machine learning methods, such as DAGSVM, one-versus-one (OVO)SVM, one-versus-all (OVA)SVM, Probabilistic neural networks (PNN), K-means clustering and fuzzy neural network (FNN) are investigated. In the same scenario, the highest classification accuracy of Hamming weight for the key reached 100%, 95.33%, 85%, 74%, 49.67% and 38% for DAGSVM, OVOSVM, OVASVM, PNN, K-means and FNN, respectively. The experiment results demonstrate the proposed model performs higher predictive accuracy and faster convergence speed.",

The results reveal that the GEP technique outperforms traditional statistical techniques in predicting oil prices. Further, the GEP model outperforms the NN and the ARIMA models in terms of the mean squared error, the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error. Finally, the GEP model also has the highest explanatory power as measured by the R-squared statistic. The results of this study have important implications for both theory and practice.",

          "Abstract": "Nowadays natural language processing plays an important and critical role in the domain of intelligent computing, pattern recognition, semantic analysis and machine intelligence. For Chinese information processing, to construct the predictive models of different semantic word-formation patterns with a large-scale corpus can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the paraphrase of the unregistered or new word, ambiguities elimination, automatic lexicography, machine translation and other applications. Therefore it is required to find the relationship between word-formation patterns and different influential factors, which can be denoted as a classification problem. However, due to noise, anomalies, imprecision, polysemy, ambiguity, nonlinear structure, and class-imbalance in semantic word-formation data, multi-criteria optimization classifier (MCOC), support vector machines (SVM) and other traditional classification approaches will give the poor predictive performance. In this paper, according to the characteristic analysis of Chinese word-formations, we firstly proposed a novel layered semantic graph of each disyllabic word, the layer-weighted graph edit distance (GED) and its similarity kernel embedded into a new vector space, then on the normalized data MCOC with kernel, fuzzification and penalty factors (KFP-MCOC) and SVM are employed to predict Chinese semantic word-formation patterns. Our experimental results and comparison with SVM show that KFP-MCOC based on the layer-weighted semantic graphs can increase the separation of different patterns, the predictive accuracy of target patterns and the generalization of semantic pattern classification on new compound words.",

          "Abstract": "Emission legislation has become progressively tighter, making the development of new internal combustion engines very challenging. New engine technologies for complying with these regulations introduce an exponential dependency between the number of test combinations required for obtaining optimum results and the time and cost outlays. This makes the calibration task very expensive and virtually impossible to carry out. The potential use of trained neural networks in combination with Design of Experiments (DoE) methods for engine calibration has been a subject of research activities in recent times. This is because artificial neural networks, compared with other data-driven modeling techniques, perform better in satisfying a majority of the modeling requirements for engine calibration including the curse of dimensionality; the use of DoE for obtaining few measurements as practicable, with the aim of reducing engine calibration costs; the required flexibility that allows model parameters to be optimized to avoid overfitting; and the facilitation of automated online optimization during the engine calibration process that eliminates the need for user intervention. The purpose of this review is to give an overview of the various applications of neural networks in the calibration of spark-ignition engines. The identified and discussed applications include system identification for rapid prototyping, virtual sensing, use of neural networks as look-up table surrogates, emerging control strategies and On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) applications. The demerits of neural networks, future possibilities and alternatives were also discussed.",

The proposed HABC based on life-cycle is a cooperative and varying-population model where the bee can switch its state periodically according to the local environmental landscape. Through this new characteristic, two significant merits of reducing redundant search and maintaining diversity of population can be obtained. In addition, with the social learning, the information exchange ability of the bees can be enhanced in the early exploration phase while the Powell\u2019s method enables the bees to deeply exploit around the promising area, which provides an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation. Then, eight basic benchmarks, seven CEC 2005 composite functions, and a real-world problem of RFID networks optimization are solved by HABC, successively. The experimental results validate the incorporated combinatorial strategies and demonstrate the performance superiority of HABC.",

          "Abstract": "At a novel pH value of the polymeric solution (6.2), variable chitosan (Cs) and sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) concentrations and mass ratios were optimized to improve the process yield without undesirable particle flocculation. Prepared formulations were characterized in terms of particle size (PS), zeta potential (ZP) and percentage yield (% yield). Artificial neural networks (ANN) were built up and used to identify the parameters that control nanoparticle (NP) size and yield, in addition to being tested for their ability to predict these two experimental outputs. Using these networks, it was found that TPP concentration has the greatest effect on PS and% yield. The most optimum formulation was characterized by a notable process yield reaching 91.5%, a mean hydrodynamic PS 227nm, ZP+24.13mv and spherical compact morphology. Successful Cs-TPP interaction in NP formation was confirmed by both Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This study demonstrated the ability of ANN to predict not only PS of the formed particles but also NP% yield. This may have a great impact on Cs-TPP NPs preparation and can be used to customize the required target formulations.",

          "Abstract": "In this paper, multi-layer feed forward neural networks are used to predict the lower heating value of gas (LHV), lower heating value of gasification products including tars and entrained char (LHVp) and syngas yield during gasification of municipal solid waste (MSW) during gasification in a fluidized bed reactor. These artificial neural networks (ANNs) with different architectures are trained using the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt (LM) back-propagation algorithm and a cross validation is also performed to ensure that the results generalise to other unseen datasets. A rigorous study is carried out on optimally choosing the number of hidden layers, number of neurons in the hidden layer and activation function in a network using multiple Monte Carlo runs. Nine input and three output parameters are used to train and test various neural network architectures in both multiple output and single output prediction paradigms using the available experimental datasets. The model selection procedure is carried out to ascertain the best network architecture in terms of predictive accuracy. The simulation results show that the ANN based methodology is a viable alternative which can be used to predict the performance of a fluidized bed gasifier.",

          "Abstract": "Human multi-limb segmentation in RGB images has attracted a lot of interest in the research community because of the huge amount of possible applications in fields like Human\u2013Computer Interaction, Surveillance, eHealth, or Gaming. Nevertheless, human multi-limb segmentation is a very hard task because of the changes in appearance produced by different points of view, clothing, lighting conditions, occlusions, and number of articulations of the human body. Furthermore, this huge pose variability makes the availability of large annotated datasets difficult. In this paper, we introduce the HuPBA8k+ dataset. The dataset contains more than 8000 labeled frames at pixel precision, including more than 120000 manually labeled samples of 14 different limbs. For completeness, the dataset is also labeled at frame-level with action annotations drawn from an 11 action dictionary which includes both single person actions and person\u2013person interactive actions. Furthermore, we also propose a two-stage approach for the segmentation of human limbs. In the first stage, human limbs are trained using cascades of classifiers to be split in a tree-structure way, which is included in an Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) framework to define a body-like probability map. This map is used to obtain a binary mask of the subject by means of GMM color modelling and Graph-Cuts theory. In the second stage, we embed a similar tree-structure in an ECOC framework to build a more accurate set of limb-like probability maps within the segmented user mask that are fed to a multi-label Graph-Cut procedure to obtain final multi-limb segmentation. The methodology is tested on the novel HuPBA8k+ dataset, showing performance improvements in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, a baseline of standard action recognition methods for the 11 actions categories of the novel dataset is also provided.",

          "Abstract": "The sharp rise in consumer computing, electronic and mobile devices and data volumes has resulted in increased workloads for digital forensic investigators and analysts. The number of crimes involving electronic devices is increasing, as is the amount of data for each job. This is becoming unscaleable and alternate methods to reduce the time trained analysts spend on each job are necessary.This work leverages standardised knowledge representations techniques and automated rule-based systems to encapsulate expert knowledge for forensic data. The implementation of this research can provide high-level analysis based on low-level digital artefacts in a way that allows an understanding of what decisions support the facts. Analysts can quickly make determinations as to which artefacts warrant further investigation and create high level case data without manually creating it from the low-level artefacts. Extraction and understanding of users and social networks and translating the state of file systems to sequences of events are the first uses for this work.A major goal of this work is to automatically derive \u2018events\u2019 from the base forensic artefacts. Events may be system events, representing logins, start-ups, shutdowns, or user events, such as web browsing, sending email. The same information fusion and homogenisation techniques are used to reconstruct social networks. There can be numerous social network data sources on a single computer; internet cache can locate\u00a0Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Plus caches; email has address books and copies of emails sent and received; instant messenger has friend lists and call histories. Fusing these into a single graph allows a more complete, less fractured view for an investigator.Both event creation and social network creation are expected to assist investigator-led triage and other fast forensic analysis situations.",

          "Abstract": "Companion or \u2018pet\u2019 robots can be expected to be an important part of a future in which robots contribute to our lives in many ways. An understanding of emotional interactions would be essential to such robots\u2019 behavior. To improve the cognitive and behavior systems of such robots, we propose the use of an artificial topological consciousness that uses a synthetic neurotransmitter and motivation, including a biologically inspired emotion system. A fundamental aspect of a companion robot is a cross-communication system that enables natural interactions between humans and the robot. This paper focuses on three points in the development of our proposed framework: (1) the organization of the behavior including inside-state emotion regarding the phylogenetic consciousness-based architecture; (2) a method whereby the robot can have empathy toward its human user\u2019s expressions of emotion; and (3) a method that enables the robot to select a facial expression in response to the human user, providing instant human-like \u2018emotion\u2019 and based on emotional intelligence (EI) that uses a biologically inspired topological online method to express, for example, encouragement or being delighted. We also demonstrate the performance of the artificial consciousness based on the complexity level and a robot\u2019s social expressions that are designed to enhance the users affinity with the robot.",

          "Abstract": "Graph construction from data constitutes a pre-stage in many machine learning and computer vision tasks, like semi-supervised learning, manifold learning, and spectral clustering. The influence of graph construction procedures on learning tasks and their related applications has only received limited study despite its critical impact on accuracy. State-of-the-art graphs are built via sparse coding adopting \u21131 regularization. Those graphs exhibit good performance in many computer vision applications. However, the locality and similarity among instances are not explicitly used in the coding scheme. Furthermore, due to the use of \u21131 regularization, these construction approaches can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we investigate graph construction using the data self-representativeness property. By incorporating a variant of locality-constrained linear coding (LLC), we introduce and derive four variants for graph construction. These variants adopt a two phase LLC (TPLLC). Compared with the recent \u21131 graphs, our proposed objective function, associated with three variants, has an analytical solution, and thus, is more efficient. A key element of the proposed methods is the second phase of coding that allows data closeness, or locality, to be naturally incorporated. It performs a coding over some selected relevant samples and reinforces the individual regularization terms by exploiting the coefficients estimated in the first phase. Comprehensive experimental results using several benchmark datasets show that it can achieve or outperform existing state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, it is shown to be more efficient than the robust \u21131 graph construction schemes.",

          "Abstract": "Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) becomes a hot topic in machine learning and pattern recognition. It has been shown that constructing an informative graph is one of the most important steps in SSL since a good graph can significantly affect the final performance of learning algorithms. This paper has the following main contributions. First, we introduce a new graph construction method based on data self-representativeness and Laplacian smoothness (SRLS). Second, this method is refined by incorporating an adaptive coding scheme aiming at getting a sparse graph. Third, we propose two kernelized versions of the SRLS method. A series of experiments on several public image data sets show that the proposed methods can out-perform many state-of-the-art methods. It is shown that Laplacian smoothness criterion is indeed a powerful tool to get informative graphs.",

          "Abstract": "In this paper we introduce a method to develop knowledge bases for medical decision support systems, with a focus on evaluating such knowledge bases. Departing from earlier efforts with concept maps, we developed an ontological-semantic knowledge base and evaluated its information content using the metrics we have developed, and then compared the results to the UMLS backbone knowledge base. The evaluation method developed uses information entropy of concepts, but in contrast to previous approaches normalizes it against the number of relations to evaluate the information density of knowledge bases of varying sizes. A detailed description of the knowledge base development and evaluation is discussed using the underlying algorithms, and the results of experimentation of the methods are explained. The main evaluation results show that the normalized metric provides a balanced method for assessment and that our knowledge base is strong, despite having fewer relationships, is more information-dense, and hence more useful. The key contributions in the area of developing expert systems detailed in this paper include: (a) introduction of a normalized entropy-based evaluation technique to evaluate knowledge bases using graph theory, (b) results of the experimentation of the use of this technique on existing knowledge bases.",

Existing ontology-based profiling approaches employ a pre-built reference ontology as a backbone structure for representing the scholar\u2019s preferences. However, such singular reference ontologies lack sufficient ontological concepts and are unable to represent the hierarchical structure of scholars\u2019 knowledge. They rather encompass general-purpose topics of the domain and are inaccurate in representing the scholars\u2019 knowledge. This paper proposes a method for integrating of multiple domain taxonomies to build a reference ontology, and exploits this reference ontology for profiling scholars\u2019 background knowledge. In our approach, various topics of Computer Science domain from Web taxonomies are selected, transformed by DBpedia, and merged to construct a reference ontology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by measuring five quality-based metrics as well as application-based evaluation against the developed reference ontology. The empirical results show an improvement over the existing reference ontologies in terms of completeness, richness, and coverage.",

These environments have the ability to be anticipatory, responsive and intelligent providers of assistive services anytime and anywhere. These services can assist frail persons effectively in their daily tasks. One of the main challenging research problems in assistive robotics is to endow ubiquitous robots with ability to pro-actively taking on some tasks to help humans in performing complex activities, by participating with them just as other humans do, in normal societies or organizations.In this paper, we propose a collective intelligence framework based on narrative reasoning and natural language processing. In the proposed approach, we propose a hybrid model that bridges together the Narrative Knowledge Representation Language (NKRL), from natural language processing field, and the HARMS (Humans, software Agents, Robots, Machines and Sensors) model, from multi-agent systems engineering field. This model is able to (i) drive the dialogues between humans, robots and smart devices, (ii) understand a complex situation, and (iii) trigger reactive actions, in the ubiquitous environment, according to given contexts.Two scenarios dedicated to the assistance of a frail person in a smart home equipped with a companion robot and smart objects are implemented and discussed for validation purposes of the proposed framework.",
